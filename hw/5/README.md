1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphics. Shapes, Color, Size, Position, Line width and type.
2. Those can represent continous data and those that can not
3. Continous data values: values for which arbitrarily fine intermediates exist; an example is height. Discrete data values: arbitrarily fine intermediates do not exist; an example is the number of animals in a zoo
4. Categorical
5. Ordered data example: elementary school, middle school, high school. Unordered data example: book, pen, mug  
6.
  + Month column: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Ordered.
  + Day column: Quantitive, Numerical, Discrete, Ordered.
  + Location column: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered.
  + Station ID column: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered.
  + Temperature column: Quantitive, Numerical, Continous, Unordered.
7.  Coordinate axes
8.  The Robinson map of the globe depicts the earth's angular and area distortions
9.  The black or red one
10.  A data set that can be logically joined from either end of the scale
11.
  + Qualitative color scale: used to distguisdh discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order.
  + Sequential color scale: colors that can represent data values.
  + Diverging color scale: used to visualize the deviation of data values in one or two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
  + Accent color scales: used as a tool to highlight specific elements in data
12. The graph has two different units so the grid sizes should be different
13.
