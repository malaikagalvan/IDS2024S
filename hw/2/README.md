 
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer
3. Because they are easy to represent electronically
4. CPU
5. Hard Drive
6. A bit
7. a) Assembly
   b) No
8. a) Fortran
   b) It is around 70 decades old
9. Assembly
10. Fortran, C, are C++ second generation. MATLAB, Python, and R are fourth generation.
11. BCPL
12. C
13. MATLAB: Fortran Python: ABC
14. Registers
15. A bit
16. Internal register is faster than RAM
17. 100 ns
18. 100 ns
19. They control or amplify an electric current.
20. The more transistors you add to computers the smaller the transistors get. This will cause the transistors to not function properly in the circuits.
21. Fetch, Decode, Execute
22. Yes, if the slower computer has better memory.
23. Memory access because modern computers have a hierarchal memory structure with various sizes and speeds.
24. Dennard scaling is the same thing as MOSFET scaling. Dennard/MOSFET scaling implies that a CPU will become faster with more transistors added to an IC. Moore's law is a prediction that the number of transistors will double every two years.
