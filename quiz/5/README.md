1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic  
2. This that can represent data continous data and those that can not  
3. Factors: variables holding qualitative data. Levels: different categories
4. Continous data: integers. Discrete data: number of people in a classroom
5. Factors
6. Ordered data: small, medium, large. Unordered data: School IDS
7. For data of a periodic nature. These data can be logically joined to data values at the other end.
8.  Qualitative color scale: used to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have instrinsic order. Sequential color scale: Color to represent data values. Diverging color scale: visualize the deviation of data values relative to a neutral midpoint. Accent color scales: colors as a tool to highlight.
9.  It is difficult to accurately see the data with 3D plots.
10.  Numerical: number of days. Categorical: months
11.  Categorical/Unordered
12.  All of them
13.  The purple to green palette
14. + San Diego
